#
# Aliases to docker rules
#
# Those rules are here to create a logic presentation of our docker images.
# Docker images generated by bazel are tagged with the same name of their
# rule. For example, the docker_build target //foo:bar will create a
# bazel/foo:bar docker image.
# To sanitize names of the docker images generated by this project, we
# create some kind of alias to the original rule so every docker components
# our project needs are tagged as bazel/powerspikegg:component.
