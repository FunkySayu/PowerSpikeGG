# Contribution basics

You are willing to help us? Great! First, thank you very much. Second, sorry
about what you are going to read :)

We have a set of rules in order to make this repository as much as possible
maintainable. We are definitely aware that "rules suxx", but we need it.

# Style guide

We use many languages in this project. Some solutions are opinion based, some
others are requirements (keep in mind it is originally a school project, so we
have to use technologies seen during classes).

For consistency purpose, we use the [Google Style Guides][gsg] in as much
languages as possible. Here are the references for all languages:

- [C++ Style Guide][cpp]
- [Objective-C Style Guide][objc]
- [Java Style Guide][java]
- [Python Style Guide][py]
- [R Style Guide][r]
- [Shell Style Guide][sh]
- [HTML/CSS Style Guide][htmlcss]
- [JavaScript Style Guide][js]
- [AngularJS Style Guide][angular]
- [Common Lisp Style Guide][cl]
- [Vimscript Style Guide][vim]

# Git workflow

For standard developers (not contributors), we use a specific
[git workflow][gitwf]. We highly recommand to read it carefully.

For contributors, we use a workflow close to the
[Angular Submission Guidelines][angularwf]. Note that if you want to
contribute, please send us an email first at funkysayu@gmail.com.
